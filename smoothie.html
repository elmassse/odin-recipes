        <p>This high-protein 4-ingredient banana peach smoothie is thick, creamy, and tastes just like dessert! It is a great breakfast or snack option that you can throw together in less than 5 minutes.</p>

       <h1> Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><em>Peach</em></strong> I like to use fresh peaches for my peach smoothie because I can control how ripe they are but if you donâ€™t have access to fresh peaches you can always use frozen peaches.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Banana</em></strong> I use very ripe bananas to make sure that the smoothie is sweet.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Milk</em></strong> I have used dairy and non dairy milk for this recipe. But for the sake of keeping this smoothie high protein I like to use dairy milk.</li>
            <li><strong><em>Greek yogurt</em></strong>Greek yogurt is packed with protein, use an unweetened greek yogurt for a creamy and high protein smoothie.</li>
        </ul>
